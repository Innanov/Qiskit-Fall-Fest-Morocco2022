# Qiskit Fall Fest Morocco 2022

## Welcome
We're so exciting to have you all here!

The [Qiskit Fall Fest](https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-fall-fest-feb8456b557) is a collection of quantum computing events on college campuses around the world. Every Fall Fest event is organized and run by the students on each campus, with support from the entire IBM Quantum team. Student leaders work alongside IBM throughout the month of September to design and plan their event, which are then run in October. The events vary from technical hackathons to beginner-friendly challenges, all with the goal of helping to grow the local communityâ€™s skill set.

The Fall Fest Morocco is going to be a hackathon, starting on October 29th. Details about the hackathon and rules can be found below. The deadline for all projects is November 1st, at 12am. Any projects submitted after that will NOT be judged. Good luck!
